***** DYNAMODB *****
https://docs.amplify.aws/react/build-a-backend/data/connect-to-existing-data-sources/connect-external-ddb-table/ <-- These are the amplify docs for this process

amplify add storage
select NoSQL Database
A new database will need to be created for every single one...
* use a string-set OR a list for the ingredients and the instructions
* make the userID the partition key
* make the recopied the sort key
* make the category the GSI key

add lambda trigger? No
amplify push
